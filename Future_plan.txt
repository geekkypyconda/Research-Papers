1. Setup Initialization: Get the system up and running.

2. Attack Detection: Use MobiXpert xApp to detect UE based attacks (e.g, Blind DoS, BTS Resource Depletion).

3. Attack Detection: Detection of MITM Based Attacks (e.g, Uplink DoS Attack)

4. Custom Rules: Implement custom rules in SecSM to collect additional parameters.

5. Anomaly Detection xApp: Develop a custom xApp to detect anomalies using heuristic approaches.

6. Anomaly Detection using ML: Use Machine Learning in an xApp for advanced anomaly detection.
